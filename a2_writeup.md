# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
    It was difficult for me to use Python since I am used to JavaScript. A problem I frequently encountered was the indentation. The program would tell me that there was an issue with it but sometimes regardless of how many times I changed it, the problem would still be present. The usage of some functions/operators (like append) is still a bit confusing as it has been a while since I used them. Luckily,it becomes more familiar/I remember what it does as I become more exposed to it. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
    We could use the match function to match the user input to the information in the movie database. For example if the user asked for the director of a movie, the movie they asked for could be searched in the database and return the name of its director.
